# Apple App Store ASO Optimization

## Overview

This skill enables comprehensive Apple App Store Optimization (ASO) analysis and metadata generation. Analyze existing app listings, generate optimized metadata following Apple's guidelines and character limits, provide competitive insights, and recommend screenshot storyboard strategies.

## Core Workflow

When a user requests ASO optimization or metadata review:

1. **Analyze the App Context**
   - Understand the app's purpose, features, and target audience
   - Identify unique value propositions and competitive differentiators
   - Note any changes or updates the user mentions

2. **Load ASO Knowledge Base**
   - Reference `references/aso_learnings.md` for comprehensive ASO best practices
   - Apply competitive analysis strategies
   - Use proven optimization patterns

3. **Generate Optimized Metadata**
   - Create optimized app name, subtitle, and promotional text
   - Write compelling description with keyword optimization
   - Generate keyword list with strategic placement
   - Ensure all metadata follows Apple's character limits

4. **Validate Character Counts**
   - Use `scripts/validate_metadata.py` to verify all metadata meets Apple's requirements
   - Display validation results with character counts and limit compliance
   - Flag any violations with specific corrections needed

5. **Provide Screenshot Strategy**
   - Recommend screenshot storyboard sequence
   - Suggest messaging hierarchy and visual focus areas
   - Align screenshot strategy with metadata messaging

## Apple App Store Character Limits

**Critical Limits to Validate:**
- **App Name**: 30 characters maximum
- **Subtitle**: 30 characters maximum
- **Promotional Text**: 170 characters maximum
- **Description**: 4,000 characters maximum
- **Keywords**: 100 characters maximum (comma-separated, no spaces)
- **What's New**: 4,000 characters maximum

## Metadata Validation Process

After generating recommendations, always validate using the validation script:

```bash
python scripts/validate_metadata.py
```

The script will:
1. Prompt for each metadata field
2. Calculate character counts
3. Check against Apple's limits
4. Display results with ‚úÖ (pass) or ‚ùå (fail) indicators
5. Show exact character counts and remaining characters

**Integration Pattern:**
- Generate metadata recommendations
- Run validation script with recommended content
- Display validation results to user
- Adjust any failing fields and re-validate

## Output Format

Structure recommendations as:

### üì± App Metadata Recommendations

**App Name** (X/30 characters)
[optimized name]

**Subtitle** (X/30 characters)
[optimized subtitle]

**Promotional Text** (X/170 characters)
[promotional text]

**Keywords** (X/100 characters)
[keyword,list,no,spaces]

**Description** (X/4000 characters)
[full description]

### üéØ Competitive Analysis
[Key insights and positioning recommendations]

### üì∏ Screenshot Storyboard Strategy
[Ordered list of screenshot recommendations with messaging]

### ‚úÖ Validation Results
[Output from validation script showing compliance]
